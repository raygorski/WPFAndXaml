# WPFandXaml
This is a collection of tutorials for WPF and XAML.  Added notes on the different rabbit holes I went down during the process.

See the Tutorial_ReadMe.txt to see the notes from the rabbit holes.  Tried to steer away from 'magic' strings, but got tired of waiting for the vpn to connect and then navigate to the desired directory...in GrepToy.xaml
